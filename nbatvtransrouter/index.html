    <br><p>Beginning with the 2015-2016 season, NBA TV will be using a new method of changing routes to TOC when transitioning from a show in one control room to the other. The 3 control rooms that are part of this new workflow are <b>PCR 21</b>, <b>PCR 24</b>, and <b>PCR 23</b>.<br><br>
	 In this new format, the external aux router in PCR 21 (on the bottom of the router stack to the left of the TD) will be the "transmission" router used to swap routes to TOC. What this means is that the switcher in PCR 21 is now the cross point to TOC. The PCR 21 switcher MUST remain online and active when shows are being sent to TOC from either PCR 24 or PCR 23 (and of course, PCR 21, as this external aux/transmission router is an extension of the PCR 21 switcher).<br><br> <b>Do not restart this switcher under any circumstances while shows are going on in PCR 24 or PCR 23 as it will terminate their transmission to TOC. If this cannot be avoided and  the switcher in PCR 21 MUST be restarted, the PCR 21 TD MUST first route whichever control room is “on air” at the time directly to the outbound tie lines (Ties 3 and 24) before the switcher is taken down; this would be need to done in Page 15 of the Preselect Router (top of the router stack). Also, that route has to be the second (02) output of each room for the embedded audio to pass. Note that this should be done in a commercial break as the preselect router is not timed in the same way the transmission router is and will result in a "blip" on air if changed.</b>

     <p style="font-size:16px">PCR 24 and PCR 23 outputs are mapped as buttons on the switcher in PCR 21. <b>PCR’s 23 and 24 will <u>NEVER</u> take PCR 21 as a source.</b> Instead, PCR 21 will take PCR’s 23 and 24 as a source when approaching a situation that requires a router change.</p>

     <p style="font-size:16px">Through the engineering setup on the Kayenne in PCR 21, output 52 of the switcher has been designated as Aux 52. This “Aux 52” destination is routable as CR21_52, and Aux 52 has been set as ALL destinations on the External Aux router. Sources on this router are setup as PCR 21, PCR 24 and PCR 23. Additionally, Bars and Black are set as sources on this router as well. None of the other buttons will be active on this router, and the buttons that can’t be disabled through the engineering setup in the switcher (there are 8 of these buttons) will be permanently covered up. It should be noted that the Bars source on the router is not internal switcher bars, but rather house bars (TST 101) as they have associated Audio. In order to accommodate this, another preselect was required for Bars. <b>We are using Preselect 57 for this route.</b>

	       <p style="font-size:16px">Output 52 of PCR 21 (CR21_52) is then being routed down Outbound Tie Lines 3 and 24 to TOC. This route is located on Page 15 of the Preselect Router to the left of the TD in PCR 21. Please note that changing this router source is the ONLY way we can bypass the Aux router, and <b>this route should only be changed in the case of an emergency or malfunction with the switcher/router in PCR 21.</b>

		<ol>
		<li>
      <p>PCR 21 TD is cutting their show with PCR 24 output (which is mapped as a button on PCR 21 switcher) in Preset. Audio also needs to have PCR 24 tracked full at this point. <b>*Make sure PCR 24 knows that their audio is being tracked full at this point!*</b></p>

      <p>Talent from FanDuel throws to Starters (also coordinated by AD's from both rooms).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
      <p>PCR 24 runs opening animation. As soon as this animation runs, PCR 21 TD takes (or quickly dissolves) to PCR 24.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
      <p>PCR 21 TD switches sources ("Punches the Button") to PCR 24 on transmission router. PCR 24 now has full control and PCR 21 is free to continue with pre-production, etc.</p>

		<ol>
		<li>
      <p>PCR 23 goes to break. In the break, the PCR 21 TD give control ("Punches the Button") back to PCR 21.</p>

      <p>PCR 21 AD informs PCR 23 that 21 now has control.</p>

		<li>
      <p>PCR 21 comes back from break and does their cutin, tossing back to PCR 23 by effecting/dissolving to PCR 23 in the switcher.</p>

		<ol>
		<li>
      <p>Game is approaching a point of transition. For consistency's sake, let's call this 30 seconds to go in the 2nd quarter and the horn to end the 4th quarter (if there is no possibility of overtime this may be done with 30 seconds to go in the 4th quarter).</p>

		<li>
      <p>PCR 21 TD takes control back from PCR 23 via transmission router ("Punches the Button"). <b>It's important to note that even though PCR 21 has control at this point, PCR 23 is still online until the game is over. Never assume you are clear until the PCR 21 AD confirms it!</b></p>

		<li>
      <p>PCR 21 AD informs PCR 23 that 21 now has control.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
      <p>PCR 21 TD can now effect/dissolve back to studio when quarter ends.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
      <p>PCR 21 AD can now inform PCR 23 that their shot is clear.</p>
